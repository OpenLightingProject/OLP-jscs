# Javascript Style Guide for the Open Lighting Project

This repo holds the style guide configuration for Javascript used in Open Lighting Projects. We use the Javascript Code Style tool: https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs to enforce this style.

The configuration is used by:
 - OLA
 - The RDM website, http://rdm.openlighting.org
